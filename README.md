# Pet Sanctuary - Virtual Pet Jam 2022


**Gameplay**

Hey, have you ever managed a Pet Sanctuary? Oh no? It is not that complicated, let me guide you through it... First of all, you need to know that Pet Sanctuary is a place to shelter animals found in danger zones, so take extra care of them! And how to do so? Good question! It is simple: you collect woods in the front yard, then go back to the building and use the Resource Trader Machine to sell wood and buy food, soaps and toys. Give those supplies to the animals in order to keep them satisfied. Feel that you can afford more animals? Awesome! Just head back to the building and use the Animal Creator Machine to do so. Pretty simple, hum? Hope you like it and good game!

The game was our entry for the 17-day Virtual Pet Jam 2022 which used the prompt "In the Zone" as the sub-theme. Huge thanks to Marília for accepting to join the team during the middle of the Jam.
